## Golang uuid library.


# FAQ
                
Why?         
* golang doesn't have an inbuilt uuid lib
* pet project to help me learn golang                                

Is it done yet?             
* No
* Only uuid versions 3, 4 and 5 are implemented. I don't think I'll ever implement uuid version 1
